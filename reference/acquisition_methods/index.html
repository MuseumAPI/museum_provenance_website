          <h1>Acquisition Method Vocabulary</h1>
          <p>
            In order to differentiate the various ways that objects are acquired, we have developed a small thesaurus of terms used to distinguish between methods of acquisition.  These terms are broken into six categories:  Transfers, Originations, Disappearances, Divisions of Custody, Rejoinings of Custody, and Party Transformations.  Each of these contains a structured hierarchy, where each term is more specific than the term above it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This document contains a human-readable version of this thesauri.  We also have a SKOS version of this thesauri
            <a href='/acquisition_methods.ttl' target='_blank'>available on the site.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have a
            <a href="/pdfs/acqusition_diagram_v.0.2.pdf">PDF diagram of the acquisition methods</a>
            available for download and printing.

            <h2 id="transfer-of-an-object">Transfer of an Object</h2>
            
            <p>This category of events represents the transfer of ownership of an object 
            from one party to another.  This includes transfers that involve the
            exchange of value, such as purchases or exchanges.  This also includes 
            transfers that do not involve the exchange of value, such as gifts or bequests.
            This also includes transfers through illegal means, such as theft or looting.</p>

            <h2 id="origination-of-an-object">Origination of an Object.</h2>
            
            <p>This category of events describe the beginning of an object.  This may
            represent the creation of an object or the moment in which the object began
            to be perceived as an art object.  This relates to the specific physical or 
            conceptual object being described; for instance, this could describe the a 
            specific print of a photograph OR the conceptual entity of the photo, 
            but should not be used to record both in a single provenance record.</p>
            
            <p>All objects are assumed to have be originated. Origination MUST be the first
            event in the provenance of an object.  If a record does not have an origination
            event as the first event in the provenance, a generic origination event with
            no date and an unknown party is assumed.</p>

            <p><strong>Preferred Form:</strong> gave origin by</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>       gave origin by Vincent Price [1911-1993], St. Louis, Missouri, July 1969.</p>
