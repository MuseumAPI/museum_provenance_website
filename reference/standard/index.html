            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>At the Carnegie Museum of Art, as with many institutions, provenance is recorded in a text field within our collections management system.  As such, there is no machine-readable structure, and it is cumbersome or difficult to automatically analyze the data contained within.</p>
            
            <p>One of the goals of the Art Tracks project has been to generate a digital model for storing and capturing the data within provenance in a machine-readable format. This document contains our best understanding of that model, along with supporting information and examples.</p>
            
            <p>There are three expressions of this standard.  One  is a textual model that functions as an extension of the AAM recommended provenance text.  The second is as an abstract data model in JSON. The third is as a Linked Open Data, as an RDF model using the CIDOC-CRM. All three expressions are compatible and can be converted to each other.</p>
            
            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            
            <p>Currently, there are two models for provenance within the cultural heritage space.</p>
            
            <p>We have the standard, textual provenance document which has been used for the past two hundred-or-so years. This document describes a complex network of relationships between parties, events, locations, and objects in a concise, semi-structured format.  It contains a remarkable wealth of detail about the history of the object, but it relies heavily on the expertise of the reader to be understandable. There are a large number of implicit statements, events, and entities that would need to be extracted from the data to represent the recorded knowledge of provenance in a machine-readable form.</p>
            
            <p>We also have the CIDOC-CRM, a robust conceptual model for event-based modeling of the history of a object, built upon 20+ years of research into the practices of cultural heritage.  CIDOC-CRM is an extremely comprehensive model capable of representing knowledge at a level of detail that far surpasses what we currently capture in our provenance documents.  It is explicitly designed to support event-based knowledge like that which makes up provenance. However, the complexity of the CRM requires a deep understanding of both the field and the potential uses of the knowledge to appropriately choose a level of detail for modeling provenance.</p>
            
            <p>The software in use at cultural institutions currently work with textual provenance.  They contain a transcription of the text, but not a digital model of the <em>meaning</em> of the text.  However, the tools museums use to record their collections information are robust, well-understood, and deeply embedded into daily museum practice.</p>
            
            <p>To our knowledge, there are no tools currently in production that support the CIDOC-CRM model of provenance.  There are several research projects underway to transition from the document-based structure of existing collections management towards an event-based model, but they are more than five years away from broad adoption in the museum community.</p>
            
            <p>The Art Tracks project is designed to ease the transition between these two models. It is explicitly an interim solution, but one that is designed to work within our existing infrastructure, while preparing us to migrate to a semantic, event-based model in the future.</p>

            <h3 id="new-sections">New Sections</h3>
            
            <p>Traditionally, provenance consists of two semantically different sections. One is the paragraph of semi-structured text that contains a list of transfers ordered from first owner until the present day. The other is a collection of footnotes which provide unstructured content, commentary, and documentation of sources. In order for provenance written using this standard to remain legible for traditional scholars, we have not fundamentally changed the written representation of either of these sections. However, in order to add additional metadata that enhances the provenance record, we have added two additional sections to the text: an <strong>Authorities</strong> section and a <strong>Citations</strong> section.<sup id="fnref:new_section"><a href="#fn:new_section" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

            <h3 id="artist-as-first-period">Artist as first period</h3>
            
            <p>The first period recorded in provenance should be the artist.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Created by Sue Smith, the artist;</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This allows the provenance to cover the entire existence of the work.  Within the aquisition method list, there are several phrases used to indicate this, and it is also appropriate (but not required) to add <code>the artist</code> as a clause after the name.</p>
            
            <h3 id="capitalization-of-the-first-letter">Capitalization of the first letter</h3>
            
            <p>If this is the first record or the previous record ends in a period, capitalize the first word.  Otherwise, use standard capitalization. (if it’s a proper name, capitalize, if it’s not, don’t.)</p>
            
            <h3 id="period-certainty">Period Certainty</h3>
            
            <p>If the entire period is uncertain, begin the period phrase with <code>Possibly </code>, otherwise nothing.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
            
            <h3 id="acquisition-method">Acquisition Method</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The method of acquisition or transfer.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Acquisition methods describe the means and terms around the transfer of custody and/or ownership of the work.  This covers standard methods such as sales or gifts, but it also covers creation, destruction, loans, and other ways that artwork can be transferred.  In particular, is is worth mentioning party transformations, which are transfers that happen when the legal owner of the work changes because the owner’s legal identity has changed, not because of any transfer of the work itself:  for example, marriage, widowhood, or institutional consolidation.</p>
            
            <p>An exhaustive list of these terms is available <a href="/reference/acquisition_methods">on our website</a>, as well as a <a href="/acquisition_methods.ttl">SKOS ontology</a> that defines the vocabulary.</p>
            
            <p>Each term has a name, but it also has a preferred phrase that signifies that term for use in written provenance.  When writing provenance, this acquisition method phrase appears before the name.</p>
            
            <h3 id="types-of-parties">Types of Parties</h3>
            
            <p>When reviewing these records, there are often multiple people involved: owners, custodians, agents, and auction houses.  Often the owner and custodian are the same person, and agents may not always be present.</p>
            
            <p>When writing this, the name that appears after the acquisition method is assumed to be the acquiring party <strong>UNLESS</strong> that name clause is followed by the word “for” followed by another name clause.  In that case, the first name refers to the purchasing agent, and the second to the acquiring party.</p>
            
            <p>For example, “Purchased by John Doe” assumes that John is the acquiring party, but “Purchased by John Doe for Sally Moe” assumes that Sally is the acquiring party and John is her agent.</p>
            
            <p>If the sale is a confirmed commission and the artist is <em>not</em> assumed to have ownership of the work would also be referred to this way, for example: “Commissioned from Fritz Franz, the artist, for Sally Moe” would assume that Sally Moe was the acquiring party, and that Fritz was the artist.  In rare cases where the artist is not known, you can use the alternate form “Commissioned by Sally Moe”, though this is discouraged.</p>
            
            <p>Seller’s agents, typically auction houses and galleries, can be referred to by a name clause followed by “from”.  If there is a specific, named event involved, that event should be called out in double quotation marks, followed by a comma.</p>
            
            <p>For example, ‘Purchased by John Doe from Bitforms Gallery’ or ‘Purchased by John Doe from “Digital Works”, Bitforms Gallery’.</p>
            
            <h3 id="party-clauses">Party Clauses</h3>
            
            <p>Each individual mentioned follows the same form.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The name of the acquiring party.</strong></p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Claude Monet</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Each party begins with the name of that party.  Use the form of that name most appropriate for the provenance at that point.  It it typical to use the name as it is recorded in the primary source where the transaction is documented, or the form of the name that would have be used at the time that the acquisition took place</p>
            
            <p><strong>Titles</strong></p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Queen Elizabeth II</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Often parties have titles that are associated with them.  These should be included when relevant.  However, they MUST be included as part of the name in the authority record for the party.  See the section on Authority Records for more information about this.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Relationships</strong></p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Vincent van Gogh’s brother, Theo van Gogh.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Often it can be clarifying to state the relationship between the acquiring party and another party.  Given the myriad ways that humans can be related, this is often better addressed through a comprehensive model in an authority file.  Thus, we have chosen to not allow any possible relationship here—instead, we allow only a single, familial relationship.  If there are multiple relationships, as occasionally happens, we prioritize marriage over any other relationship.</p>
            
            <p>The allowed relationships are:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>“brother”</li>
              <li>“sister”</li>
              <li>“sibling”</li>
              <li>“mother”</li>
              <li>“father”</li>
              <li>“parent”</li>
              <li>“son”</li>
              <li>“daughter”</li>
              <li>“child”</li>
              <li>“grandchild”</li>
              <li>“grandparent”</li>
              <li>“nephew”</li>
              <li>“niece”</li>
              <li>“uncle”</li>
              <li>“aunt”</li>
              <li>“wife”</li>
              <li>“husband”</li>
              <li>“spouse”</li>
              <li>“relative”</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These clauses directly precede the acquiring party’s name, followed by a possessive <code>'s</code>, followed by the relationship and a comma.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Artist Clause</strong></p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Jackson Pollock, the artist.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The only non-familial clause allowed is “the artist”, which should appear ONLY in the first period of a provenance.  Occasionally, an artist may re-acquire a work, but in those cases it should not be explicitly mentioned that they are the artist. This clause directly follows the name, separated by a comma.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Name Certainty</strong></p>
            
            <p>If the name is uncertain, follow the name with a question mark.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>George Strait?</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>not</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Possibly George Strait</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Using a question mark and not a certainty word prevents confusion around the question of which aspect is certain of uncertain, the party or the entire record.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Initials</strong></p>
            
            <p>If the party’s name has multiple initials, use a space between them.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>J. J. Abrams</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>not</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>J.J. Abrams</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p><strong>Unknown Parties</strong></p>
            
            <p>If the party is not known, use <strong>Unknown party</strong>, <strong>Unknown collector</strong>, or something similar.  Don’t leave it blank.  Also, don’t associate unknown people with a generic authority file for <strong>all</strong> unknown people—leave the authority section as unknown unless there’s a need to create a specific unknown party.</p>
            
            <p>If the acquiring party is a marriage, a partnership, a purchase in shares, or any other form of joint ownership, there must be an entity that holds legal ownership of the work.  For instance:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mr &amp; Mrs. Marshall Fields III</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is the marriage of these two people, not either of these people themselves.  Any dates or locations should refer to the marriage, and a provenance event (typically a Transformation of Party) should occur if a marriage ends in either death or divorce.</p>
            
            <h3 id="life-dates">Life Dates</h3>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Francis Bacon [1561-1626]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>For a party, the relevant dates are their birth and death dates.  For organizations or legal entities such as a marriage or partnership, these are the dates between which the organization was in operation or the partnership was in effect.</p>
            
            <p>These are written as years, enclosed within brackets and separated by a dash.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>[1880-1955]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>If the year is unknown, or the party is still alive, exclude that date, but leave the dash.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>[1880-] or [-1955]</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>If either of the years are uncertain, follow that date with a question mark.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>[1880?-1990]</p>

            <p>Locations in provenance have traditionally been used as a way to uniquely identify individuals.  Because of this, the nature of the location traditionally recorded in provenance is ambiguous—it doesn’t have specific semantic meaning.  This standard uses Linked Data unique identifiers as a technique for uniquely identifying individuals, but having these locations present still provides benefits to humans reading the written records.</p>
            
            <p>Because of this, we have chosen to consider the location that directly follows any party’s name to be a location <strong>associated</strong> with that person.  In general, it would be appropriate to choose a location most appropriate for the object under discussion, but that is not a requirement, just a suggestion.</p>
            
            <p>For the specific location where an acquisition takes place, we’ve added the ability to have a location preceded by <code>in</code>.  This location is explicitly the location where the acquisition took place, and is often associated with an auction house or sale.  None of these locations are required, but it can be helpful if the location is known to explicitly call it out using the <code>in</code> form because it helps with location-based research.</p>
            
            <p>For example:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Purchased by John Doe, London, England;</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Would mean that London is a location primarily associated with John, even if the artwork was purchased while he was on holiday in Spain.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Purchased by John Doe in Barcelona, Spain;</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Would explicitly place that purchase in Spain, but would not associate John with Barcelona (beyond his potential presence to purchase the work).</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Purchased by John Doe, London, England, in Barcelona, Spain;</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Would explicitly state both facts.  This is often not required, but can be done if it is clarifying in some way.</p>
            
            <h4 id="writing-specific-locations">Writing Specific Locations</h4>
            
            <p>If the location is uncertain, use a question mark following the last word of the location.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Glasgow, Scotland?</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>If the location is in the US, record the city and the state (in zip code two letter abbreviated form, without periods, and with a comma between the city and the state.)</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Boston, MA</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>If the location is outside of the US, record the city, the province or state (if required to prevent ambiguous locations), and the country.  Each of these should be separated by a comma.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Paris, France</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>If the location is in a named, notable building, record that building.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Highclere Castle, Hampshire, England</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Do not record street names or street numbers within provenance locations.</p>
            
            <p>If the location has changed names over time, the name of the location is typically recorded the name of the location at the time of the acquisition.  i.e. Leningrad, not St. Petersburg, if the acquisition took place between 1924 and 1991.  All locations are typically recorded in English, and should be written using the most recognizable or appropriate form. Locations are included in the Authority section, which helps deal with the ambiguity of names for specific places.  Think of the words as being a way to describe the location as it would be referred to in art history, and the Authority record referring to a specific physical location.</p>
            
            <h3 id="named-events">Named Events</h3>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>from “Carnegie International”, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA
            from “Northbrook Sale”
            through John Doe from “Sale of Important Works”
            through Paul Durand</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>While many transactions are between private individuals and have no documentation, other come through participation in significant or named events such as gallery shows, auctions, or large sales.  Also, many of the sales were facilitated by a seller’s agent.  To record this information, we’ve added a section that we refer to as the “Named Event” section.  This section begins with  either the word “at” or the word “through”, depending on which makes grammatical sense.</p>
            
            <p>This is optionally followed by the name of the event in quotation marks.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>from “Northbrook Sale”
            from “Venice Biennial”</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>The name of the event should always appear in the Authority Section.  The name of the event can be followed by the agent, auction house, or other person or organization who arranged, facilitated, or hosted the event.  This person is referred to as the “seller’s agent”, and their format follows that of any other Party record.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>from “Northbrook Sale”, Christie’s, London, England.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Note that this location is again the location associated with the actor, not the location of the sale.</p>
            
            <h3 id="transfer-location">Transfer Location</h3>
            
            <p>In cases where the location of the transaction is explicitly known, it can be recorded using the word “in”.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Purchased by Jane Doe in Boise, ID.
            John Doe, from “Northbrook Sale”, Christies, in London, England.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is the location of the event, not that of any of the parties involved.  When it is present, it can often be redundant to have both the location of the parties and the location of the event, and our recommendation in that cases to only use the location of the event, since it will be reasonably clear that the party is associated with the event.  For historical reasons, however, it remains useful to be able to record one or both.</p>

            <p>Uncertainty is indicated with a question mark following the last part of the date phrase</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>until October 1885?</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Years are recorded in Gregorian form, using  October 4, 1582 as the first day of the Gregorian calendar.  For years earlier than 1582, use the proleptic Gregorian Calendar.</p>
            
            <p>The year immediately preceding 1 CE is 1 BCE.  There is no year zero.</p>
            
            <p>When recording periods, we always record the interval of possibility for the acquisition.  This can be done by recording the known date with appropriate precision:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>October 1990</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>implies that the work was acquired on a specific day between October 1, 1990 and October 31, 1990.  Often, though, we need to record something where either the beginning or the end of that interval is unknown, or the period described by the interval is not able to be expressed as a single imprecise date, and so we use a list of connecting phrases to explicitly describe the beginning and end of the period.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>after 1990
            by 1990 <em>or</em> before 1990
            between 1990 and 1995</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>These forms allow us to express both a precision and the bounds of the interval.  So <code>between 1990 and 1995</code> represents the interval between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1995.</p>
            
            <p>Typically, we do not need to record the deacquisition of the work within provenance events, because that transfer is recorded as an acquisition within the following period.  However, sometimes while we know when a particular collector de-acquired the work, we do not know explicitly to whom a work was transferred, and rather than create an “unknown collector” with no data other than the date, we prefer to record the deacquisition within the period of the known collector.  In these cases, we use the word <code>until</code> to indicate that the period being described is that of the deacquisition.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>until 1990
            until at least 1990
            until before 1990
            until between 1990 and 1995
            1990 until 1995</p>

            <h3 id="purchase-information">Purchase Information</h3>
            
            <p>It can often be useful to record information about the details of a sale.  There are many possible details, but we feel that the associated stock or lot number and the monetary amount associated with the transaction are both sufficiently regular that they could be captured, and sufficiently useful as structured data that we should capture them.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>(stock no. 55512, for $100,000)
            (for 5 shillings, three pence)

            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Both the stock or lot number and the amount should be enclosed within parentheses, and the amount should be preceded with the word “for”.  If both are present, use a comma between them.</p>

            <p>Footnotes are indicated by a number contained inside brackets at the end of a record, and Citations are indicated by a letter contained within brackets at the end of the record.  They should be the last thing within the clause, preceding the completing punctuation.  There should only be a single footnote per-period; if multiple notes are needed, they can be multiple sentences within the footnote.  There can be as many citations per-period as needed,  one for each clarifying document.</p>

            <h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>
            
            <p>As we have been developing the linked data model for this standard, we have had three guiding principles:</p>
            
            <p>The first is to maintain the integrity of the CIDOC-CRM, and to use the predicates and classes that it (and its extensions) provide whenever possible.<br />
            The second is to consider that the major purpose of modeling provenance as structured data is to enhance the usability of the provenance—particularly the searchability of the provenance.  At every step, we would like to enhance the ability of a user to locate specific events in the history of an object, and we aim to provide as many hooks into the provenance as possible.</p>
            
            <p>Third, we aim to capture completely the information that makes up the written provenance text.  Provenance data is extremely concise, and to omit any word from the provenance is to omit a detail that the provenance researcher deemed important.</p>
            
            <p>The structure and model presented below is our best attempt to create a standard that accomplishes our mission while abiding to the principles as closely as possible.</p>
            
            <h3 id="levels-of-provenance">Levels of Provenance</h3>
            
            <p>Linked data is still a relatively new concept in museums, and very few museums are prepared to embrace it to the level that fully modeling provenance in all its specificity entails.  To ‘shorten the on-ramp’, we have defined four levels for the digital encoding of provenance.  These levels have been designed to function as strict supersets—each level can also function as each level below. Each level provides a more complete graph of information, additional search abilities, and a more nuanced understanding of the provided provenance text.</p>
            
            <h4 id="level-one">Level One</h4>
            
            <p>When we model a provenance text we are modeling two separate but related structures. One is the written text that makes up the traditional provenance record, which we refer to as the “provenance text”. The other is the actual events and parties that the provenance text describes, which we refer to as “provenance events”.  We maintain and model both of these structures in Linked Data because they both contain nuances that are difficult to capture in the other’s form.</p>
            
            <p>Level One describes a provenance text in which the events described within the document are not modeled in any fashion, nor are the people, places, nor any other entity.  This level is intended as model for provenance within an institution where the provenance is represented a single text field and where no additional work is done to understand or interpret the provenance. The RDF model at this level merely models the existence of a provenance text, the existence of an event, and relates both to the work described.</p>
            
            <p>At this level, full text search is possible, but it is not possible to facet the information in any way.</p>
            
            <p>This model is made up of two core CRM entities: a <code>E31 Document</code> and an <code>E7 Activity</code>.  The document is the provenance text itself, and the activity records the ongoing activities of the owners of an object that involve transfers of ownership and custody<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.  Both of these entities are assigned a <code>E55 Type</code> of <a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;subjectid=300055863"><code>aat:300055863</code></a>, which is the AAT term for “provenance”.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
            
            <h4 id="level-two">Level Two</h4>
            
            <p>Level Two models builds upon Level One by associating the provenance text and event with the people, places, and URLs present within the text. This level is designed to accommodate software that is capable of processing the provenance text but doesn’t have special knowledge of provenance, such Named Entity Recognition or string matching against authority files.</p>
            
            <p>At this level, it becomes possible to connect artwork to the people and places that are mentioned in the provenance. It also enables search for provenances using alternate names (when linked to authority files), and to use URLs to link to digitized primary sources. Individual transactions and dates are not modeled at this level.</p>
            
            <h4 id="level-three">Level Three</h4>
            
            <p>Level Three models the individual transactions as specific provenance events, but considers there to only be a single event representing the transaction between periods of ownership. These transactions follow each other in time, but are not casually related. To implement this level, we assume the existence software capable of parsing individual acquisition or transfer events within provenance. All software developed as part of Art Tracks is designed to work at this level.</p>
            
            <p>At Level Three, it becomes possible to analyze and search for specific provenance transactions, and relate those transaction to people and locations. It also becomes possible to search for transactions that occurred within specific space-time volumes, such as “Continental Europe between 1932 and 1946”.</p>
            
            <h4 id="level-four-unimplemented">Level Four <em>(unimplemented)</em></h4>
            
            <p>At Level Four, we explicitly model the sub-events that make up each individual transaction. These events are casually related: each one is motivated by and dependent on the event that directly precedes it. For example, rather than modeling a loan as a single event, you would model the transfer of custody to the trucking company, followed by a transfer to the art handlers at the new location, followed by a transfer to the exhibiting institution. This level of provenance is not currently recorded in traditional provenance texts, but is the next logical step for integrating provenance into a larger model of the history of movement, ownership, and custody of art.<sup id="fnref:level4"><a href="#fn:level4" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

            <h3 id="i-why-text">I. Why Text?</h3>
            
            <p>Given the underlying structure of the provenance information, we considered several possibilities for the canonical reference for this information.  To do so, we developed the following set of guidelines for describing our goals:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Provenance must be represented as unambiguous structured data.</li>
              <li>There should only be a single source of truth for provenance data.</li>
              <li>The provenance information should follow industry standards when available.</li>
              <li>Provenance should balance simplicity, capturing nuance, and unambiguity.</li>
              <li>Information should not be discarded.</li>
              <li>The system should be designed for usability.</li>
              <li>The system should be as simple as possible.</li>
              <li>The system should be technologically feasible.</li>
              <li>Not all information can be unambiguous.</li>
              <li>Not all information can be structured.</li>
              <li>The current industry standard for provenance records is a paragraph of standardized text.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Designing for usability, as well as designing for a single source of truth, means that there exists a conflict between the traditional provenance record as a block of text and the requirements of structured data.</p>
            
            <p>One option was to ignore the requirement for a single source of truth, and have both structured and unstructured representations of provenance data.  While technically the easiest option, it is very easy for the two sources of data to diverge, and there would be no method to detect such divergences.  Enforcing data constraints with policy tends to be less than optimal, and without a detection mechanism, experience has shown that one of the two systems will become untrusted.</p>
            
            <p>Given that two versions of the data is non-optimal, the second option of converting provenance to structured data and treating the textual record as a produced artifact of the data is tempting.  This would allow the data to be the single source of truth.  This is also a technically appealing solution, since it allows the use of existing technological tools (such as relational databases) and simple data modeling constraints.</p>
            
            <p>The major issues with this option revolve around usability.  Given that most museums do not have structured provenance data, in order for the structured data to be the single source of truth, all existing records would have to be converted immediately, or a transition period would have to be enforced where either no new information is added, or all information is added to both places.  Additionally, extensive training would have to be provided to all staff on how to read and write provenance information.</p>
            
            <p>Another constraint is the flexibility of existing Collection Management Systems.  Either the CMS has to be extended to handle the new data, or there has to be a new tool added and maintained to store and handle the data.</p>
            
            <p>Given these issues, the decision was made that the primary description of the structured data should remain the paragraph of provenance text.  This has the benefit of working with existing tooling, and also allowing a gradual conversion of records without problems; however, this presents its own issues.  The largest of these issues is that text is not traditionally an excellent source of unambiguity, and the structure of either English or the AAM guidelines is not sufficient to guarantee parsability.</p>

                  <p>Both of these were designed to be human-readable without specialized software and should to be able to be written and maintained by humans. They also are designed to provide additional context not only to the computer, but to a human reader. <a href="#fnref:new_section" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                  <p>We have decided not to include a vocabulary or “levels” of uncertainty, because we don’t have a good system for determining how these levels would be specified.  We also differentiate between “Probably”, which refers to the entire period, and “?”, which we use to indicate that individual parts of the record might be questionable. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                  <p>This resolves the problem of allowing the user to maintain nuance in their choice of appellation for individuals while also providing an unambiguous ID for that individual. “Jane Doe” can be explicitly linked to the same URI as “Jane Pendleton”, a maiden name, maintaining context while disambiguating identity. <a href="#fnref:name_parts" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
                </li>
                <li id="fn:spaces">
                  <p>We allow one or more spaces so that the LOD identifiers can be aligned when presented in a text interface using a monospace font.  This is not a requirement, but is permitted. <a href="#fnref:spaces" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <li id="fn:lod_parts">
                  <p>Best practices for Linked Data also assert that these URIs should be dereferenceable using HTML, which means that a human researcher can gain immediate context for the people and places represented by the IDs by copying and pasting them into a browser. <a href="#fnref:lod_parts" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                  <p>We choose to use E7 Activity instead of E4 Period to model this series of activities for two reasons.  First, because it allows us to associate actors and objects directly with the Activity, which becomes useful at later levels, and second because we feel that it the class that most accurately represents the agency of human activity that defines this period. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                  <p>We feel that using AAT to define our types is a suitable best practice, and one that we will continue throughout this model whenever possible.  Our feeling is that the implicit assignment of AAT vocabulary terms the class E55 Type through the use of <code>crm:P2_has_type</code> is an acceptable practice despite lack of explicit statement.  An alternate model of <code>crm:P2_has_type _:type. _:type skos:exactMatch _:aat_term .</code> is possible, but does not add any additional abilities to our model while adding complexity, and as such is discouraged. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

                <li id="fn:level4">
                  <p>We do not fully define this level, and none of the Art Tracks tools are capable of modeling or mapping these events. It may seem unusual to define a level that do not implement or fully define, however we understand the utility of this level of specificity.  While we believe there would be benefits to modeling at this level, none of the institutions that we are working with have data at this level of granularity. However, as would also like to make sure that the model we are developing does not preclude the future existence of this data, we have designed the model to accommodate it when it exists. <a href="#fnref:level4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
