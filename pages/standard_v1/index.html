          <h5 id="draft-version-01brpublished-march-14-2015">Draft Version 0.1<br />Published March 14, 2015</h5>
          
          <h2 id="statement-of-problem">Statement of Problem</h2>
          
          <p>At the Carnegie Museum of Art, as with many institutions, provenance is recorded in a text field within our collections management system.  As such, there is no machine-readable structure, and it is difficult or impossible to automatically analyse the data contained within.</p>
          
          <p>One of the primary goals of Art Tracks is to defined a model and structure for storing and capturing the data within provenance in a machine-readable format.</p>
          
          <h2 id="current-standards">Current Standards</h2>
          
          <p>Traditional provenance records, while text, are designed to communicate research effectively and tersely.  As such, there are loose standards defined.</p>
          
          <p>The most common of these standards was defined by the American Association of Museums, in <em>The AAM Guide to Provenance Research</em>:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          
            <p>Provenance information should be presented in a clear and organized fashion and be as complete as possbile.  The sequence of ownership should be easily understood.  The order of ownership may be earilest to latest owner, or the reverse, as long as the chronology is obvious.  There should be some mechanism by which owners are distinguished from dealers or auctioneers.  The sources of information about each owner or transaction shuld be documented.  In publishing provenance information, the museum should include an explanation of its format.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
          
            <p>The provenance is listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest known owner. Life dates of owners, if known, are enclosed in brackets. Uncertain information is indicated by the terms "possibly" or "probably" and explained in footnotes. Dealers, auction houses, or agents are enclosed in parentheses to distinguish them from private owners. Relationships between owners and methods of transactions are indicated by punctuation: a semicolon is used to indicate that the work passed directly between two owners (including dealers, auction houses, or agents), and a period is used to separate two owners (including dealers, auction houses, or agents) if a direct transfer did not occur or is not known to have occurred. Footnotes are used to document or clarify information.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>An informal survey of American museums indicate that most museums that explicitly reference a format either use this standard directly or use a modified version with either additions or minor structural modifications.</p>
          
          <p>As such, basing our structured data model off this recommendation seems a wise course of action.</p>
          
          <h2 id="technical-considerations">Technical Considerations</h2>
          
          <p>Given the underlying structure of the provenance information, we considered several possibliities for the canonical reference for this information.  To do so, we developed the following set of guidelines for describing our goals</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Provenance must be represented as unambiguous structured data.</li>
            <li>There should only be a single source of truth for provenance data.</li>
            <li>The provenance information should follow industry standards when available.</li>
            <li>Provenance should balance simplicity, capturing nuance, and unambiguity.</li>
            <li>Information should not be discarded.</li>
            <li>The system should be designed for usability.</li>
            <li>The system should be as simple as possible.</li>
            <li>The system should be technologically feasible.</li>
            <li>Not all information can be unambiguous.</li>
            <li>Not all information can be structured.</li>
            <li>The current industry standard for provenance records is a paragraph of standardized text.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Designing for usability, as well as designing for a single source of truth, means that there exists a conflict between the traditional provenance record as a block of text and the requirements of structured data.</p>
          
          <p>One option was to ignore the requirement for a single source of truth, and have both structured and unstructured representations of provenance data.  While technically the easiest option, it is very easy for the two sources of data to diverge, and there would be no method to detect such divergences.  Enforcing data constraints with policy tends to be less than optimal, and without a detection mechanism, experience has shown that one of the two systems will become untrusted.</p>
          
          <p>Given that two versions of the data is non-optimal, the second option of converting provenance to structured data and treating the textual record as a produced artifact of the data is tempting.  This would allow the data to be the single source of truth.  This is also a technically appealing solution, since it allows the use of existing technological tools (such as relational databases) and simple data modelling constraints.</p>
          
          <p>The major issues with this option revolve around usability.  Given that most museums do not have structured provenance data, in order for the structured data to be the single source of truth, all existing records would have to be converted immediately, or a transition period would have to be enforced where either no new information is added, or all information is added to both places.  Additionally, extensive training would have to be provided to all staff on how to read and write provenance information.</p>
          
          <p>Another constraint is the flexibility of existing Collection Management Systems.  Either the CMS has to be extended to handle the new data, or there has to be a new tool added and maintained to store and handle the data.</p>
          
          <p>Given these issues, the decision was made that the primary description of the structured data should remain the paragraph of provenance text.  This has the benefit of working with existing tooling, and also allowing a gradual conversion of records without problems; however, this presents its own issues.  The largest of these issues is that text is not traditionally an excellent source of unambiguity, and the structure of either English or the AAM guidelines is not sufficient to guarantee parsability.</p>
          
          <h2 id="definition-of-provenance">Definition of Provenance</h2>
          
          <ol>
            <li>A provenance record is, at its core, a paragraph.</li>
            <li>Each paragraph describes the custody, location, and ownership of a work of art.</li>
            <li>Each paragraph is made of sentences, with each sentence representing an unbroken, known chain of custody.</li>
            <li>Each sentence has one or more clauses, separated by semicolons, that represent a single party who has had custody or ownership of the work of art.</li>
            <li>Each clause can also indicate its certainty.</li>
            <li>Each clause contains several data points, describing the party, the location, the method of acquisition, the dates of acquisition and deacquisition.</li>
            <li>Each data point can also indicate its certainty.</li>
            <li>Each clause can be annotated with footnotes, which contain additional, unstructured information about the clause.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>If there are clauses, like, "wife of previous" or "the artist", they follow the name.  These clauses are a semi controlled vocabulary—it can be extended as needed.  Please see the <em>attached list</em> for current exceptions and vocabulary.</p>

          <p>For estate and other sales, the party is the gallery or auction house that hosted the sale, not the name of the sale. The name of the sale should be contained within a footnote if known.</p>

          <p>This is the marriage of these two people, not either of these people themselves.  Any dates or locations should refer to the marriage, and a transfer of provenance should occur if a marriage ends in either death or divorce.</p>

          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Footnotes are indicated by a number contained inside brackets at the end of a record.  It should be the last thing within the record, preceding the completing punctuation.</p>
          
          <p>There should only be a single footnote per-owner.  If multiple notes are needed, they can be multiple sentences within the footnote.</p>
          
          <p>Footnotes can contain as much text as needed—they are for clarity and people, not computers.</p>
          
          <h2 id="closing-punctuation">Closing punctuation</h2>
          
          <p>If the artwork is <em>known</em> to be a direct transfer, use a semicolon at the end of the period of ownership.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Michel Buble, 1990;</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>If the artwork is <em>not</em> known to be a direct transfer, use a period.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>Michael Jackson, 1986.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>If uncertain, assume that the transfer is <strong>not</strong> direct.</p>
          
          <h2 id="dealers-and-auction-houses">Dealers and Auction Houses</h2>
          
          <p>If the owner is not a primary owner, wrap the entire ownership period in parenthesis.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>(Galarie Durand-Ruel, Paris, France, 1891);</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This maintains the historic distinction between primary owners and the auctionners or dealers.</p>
          
          <h2 id="notes-at-the-end-of-the-record">Notes at the end of the record.</h2>
          
          <p>Once all owners are recorded, footnotes appear.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>NOTES:  [1] This is a note. [2] This is also a note.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>the string ' NOTES: ' indicates that the footnote section is beginning.   each note is indicated by a number within brackets followed by the note.  Do not link multiple records to a single footnote—duplicate the information if required.   That way, unintentional changes of one owner do not accidentally propagate to other sections.</p>
          
          <p>(due to technical reasons, there is a limit of 99 footnotes per-provenance text.  If this becomes a problem, we can address this in a future version.)</p>
