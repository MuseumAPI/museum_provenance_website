#A Yinzer's Guide to Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh is a city known for its quirks. Bridges, tunnels, traffic patterns not found elsewhere on the planet, and some rather wonderfully odd places and things to eat. So some of us yinzers (Pittsburghers) have put together a handy guide to help you find the true gems of our city. If yinz (yinz = you all, "y'all", you all over there, yies, etc.) need help, just ask!

## General Stuff

If you're staying near downtown or the North Side/North Shore area, many of the things here will be within walking distance. If you're staying in Oakland or in the East End, walking to some of these things is possible, but not all of them (ie. things downtown). Pittsburgh's brand new [bike share program](https://healthyridepgh.com) can get you there, along with the standard Uber/Lyft options. Regular taxi service, like hailing a cab, generally doesn't work. Seriously, it's terrible.

If you're driving your own car, downloading the [Pittsburgh Parking Authority's app](http://www.gomobilepittsburgh.com) ahead of time is advised. The app will let you pay for parking via your phone, and top up on parking without having to leave your event or meal. Beware the parking enforcement officers-parking in the city is tough, and they take their violations seriously. Don't get caught with an expired meter. 


If you're wondering what Pittsburgh is all about, a great introduction to the city are the [Rick Seback](www.twitter.com/rickaroundhere) "It's Pittsburgh, and a Lot of Other Stuff" videos, which you can stream [here](http://www.wqed.org/tv/watch/?series=3) via our local PBS affiliate, WQED. This guy is an institution. Or, you could just ask any Pittsburgher. Pittsburghers love to talk about Pittsburgh- it's part of living here.

If you've never been to Pittsburgh before, make it a priority to get to Mount Washington to see the city from Grandview Avenue. We have info on that below.


## Strip District
The Strip would be an excellent place to walk around on the day after Web Design Day. It's where Pittsburgh goes to get...pretty much anything. Steelers shirt? Yep. Random imported Italian cheese? Got it. Cannoli? Boom. Mung bean pancakes? Got you covered. Come hungry.

#### Non-food:

* South Side is known for clubs/nightlife/bar scene. West Carson Street (the main road) is lined with bars and a few music venues. It is not advised to drive and park on the South Side during a weekend night due to the crowds, narrow streets, and lack of parking- it's better to take an Uber/Lyft or a taxi and let them drive. Generally, South Side is more popular with the college crowd. 

## Mount Washington

Really, the best thing about Mount Washington is the amazing view of the city. Ride one of the two inclines to get to Grandview Avenue! \| [Duquesne Incline - Lower Station](https://goo.gl/maps/20JP7) \| [Mon Incline - Lower Station](https://goo.gl/maps/NfqRJ)
