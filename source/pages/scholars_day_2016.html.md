# 2016 Digital Provenance Symposium

### Hosted by Carnegie Museum of Art

**Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**  
**October 14, 2016**

As part of the Art Tracks project and with the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Carnegie Museum of Art is presenting a one-day symposium that will bring together technologists, digital humanities scholars, curators, and other cultural heritage specialists to discuss 21st-century trends in digital event-based provenance for museum objects. 

[Carnegie Museum of Art](http://www.cmoa.org), in partnership with the [Yale Center for British Art](http://britishart.yale.edu) and the [Freer\|Sackler](https://www.asia.si.edu), has been developing a consensus model for representing the provenance of museum objects using Linked Open Data and the [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org). This standard consists of a Linked Data representation of this information as well as a text-based representation, based on the [American Alliance of Museums (AAM) suggested provenance text](http://www.aam-us.org/docs/default-source/professional-resources/nepip-recommended-procedures), which has been modified for this purpose. This symposium will discuss progress on this standard and on other efforts across the field to standardize the digital representation of provenance.  Additionally, we will hear from Freer\|Sackler and the Smithsonian Provenance Research Initiative, the Yale Center for British Art, and the Getty Research Institute on their related provenance projects.  

This will also be the first public presentation of the proposed mapping of provenance information to the CIDOC-CRM as used in Art Tracks.  As part of this symposium, we will be soliciting community input and feedback on the mappings.

This invitation-only event will take place at Carnegie Museum of Art on October 14, 2016. All the proceedings will be recorded and made available to the public following the conference.

## Speakers

The Art Tracks Team will present on their work as part of Art Tracks, Phase II.

**David Newbury**, Lead Developer, Art Tracks at Carnegie Museum of Art, will present on the Art Tracks project, including the Elysa provenance management software and the Linked Open Data provenance standard.

**Tracey Berg-Fulton**, Collections Database Associate at Carnegie Museum of Art, will introduce the Northbrook Initative, a proposed multi-institution collaborative Linked Open Data provenance project focused on the Northbrook collection.

**Louise Lippincott**, Curator of Fine Arts at Carnegie Museum of Art, will discuss the origins of the Art Tracks project and its potential impact on the field of art history, as well as its impact on her curatorial practice at CMOA.

**Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass**, Collections Data Manager at [Yale Center for British Art](http://britishart.yale.edu) will present on YCBA's current work on provenance and the CIDOC-CRM.

**Jeffrey Smith**, Assistant Registrar for Collections Information for the [Smithsonian’s Freer\|Sackler](https://www.asia.si.edu), will present on the museum’s provenance work and the  [*Asian Art Provenance Connections Project*](http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/provenance.asp). The Freer\|Sackler is planning a search interface for Asian art provenance linked data, with an initial focus on WWII-era provenance. The site will be designed primarily for researchers, and is intended to scale to include data from other museums with Asian collections. Jeff’s focus is on aligning the processes of research, data entry, and linking of archival and other knowledge resources to create linked data for the research and museum community.

**Ruth Cuadra**, Business Applications Administrator at the [Getty Research Institute](http://www.getty.edu/research/), will discuss experiences encountered and lessons learned while remodeling the Getty Provenance Index databases for publication as Linked Open Data, including mapping auction sales catalogs to the CIDOC-CRM, developing a URI scheme, and reconciling these resources with the Getty vocabularies.

**Jane Milosch** is director of the Smithsonian’s Provenance Research Initiative (SPRI), a pan-institutional program to facilitate provenance research at the Smithsonian, in the Office of the Provost/Undersecretary for Museums and Research. She will discuss SPRI's work with experts around the world to develop training opportunities, educational programs, joint research projects, and new technology to improve the sharing of provenance data among experts and the public. SPRI's new projects include a multi-year German/American Provenance Research Exchange Program thatwill launch in 2017, as well as a partnership with the University of Glasgow to create the first graduate studies program in provenance research, Art History: Collecting and Provenance in an International Context, starting fall 2016.

## Visiting Pittsburgh

#### Transportation:

Pittsburgh has decent public transportation, particularly in the Oakland neighborhood. [Schedules and maps are available online](http://www.portauthority.org/paac/SchedulesMaps/TripPlanner.aspx).  The bus fare is $2.50, and they take cash (exact change only).  Both Uber and Lyft are also present in Pittsburgh. 

If you are driving, there is parking available at the Museum.  

#### Hotels and Lodging

We recommend the [Ace Hotel](https://www.acehotel.com/pittsburgh) in the East Liberty neighborhood, about 2.2 miles away from the museum.  If you'd prefer a closer option, the [Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center](http://www.wyndhampittsburghuniversitycenter.com) is only a couple of blocks from CMOA.

## About Art Tracks

**Art Tracks is about discovering and recording connections between works of art and people, places, and events through history.** This ambitious project strives to standardize, digitize, and convert the provenance of works of art into structured, Linked Open Data. Starting in 2013, Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) began to build a suite of open source software tools to transform traditional written provenance records into searchable data, with an emphasis on existing data standards and a strong focus on building tools that are useful across multiple institutions. Art Tracks has the potential to influence humanities and museum scholarship by revealing unsuspected narratives within the histories of art and museums.
