Tracey is the Collections Database Associate for Art Tracks, leading the research on the art collection of the Baring family, later to include the Earls of Northbrook. Her speaking and writing focus on the intersection of collections and technology, while her research concentrates on the material culture of tenements, sanitation theory and ceramics, and museum operations in times of war. Since 2012, she has served as web chair of the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums. Tracey is a graduate of Otterbein University and the University of Glasgow. She and her husband share their home with an adopted Giant Schnabrador named Walter.
